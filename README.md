# HPCfinalproject-psoriasis.c

1.Select an article from an academic journal that describes a Cellular Automaton model and submit your selection to me for approval by Tuesday, 24-April.

2.Write a serial version of the code that implements the model in either C or Python. You must certainly wonâ€™t be writing from scratch -- I strongly encourage you to take a previous example from the course and modify it as needed. 

3.Using either OpenMP (C) or MPI (C or Python) create a parallelized version of this code. No animations are necessary.  

4.The project is due no later than 5 pm on May 14th. There are no extensions.
